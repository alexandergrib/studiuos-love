Love. What really hides behind this word?

Love often feels unexplainable, – the most mysterious of force,
that has dictated centuries of philosophy, poetry and literature.
But, according to International Science Council, love is a science. 
Beneath the flushed cheeks, there is a series of complex chemical reactions
taking place between the brain and the body.


Philosophy of Love

If scientists tend to portray love as something that can be more or less framed or defined,
for the philosophers, as could be expected, this subject is more "blurred".
Internet Encyclopedia of Phylosophy states that:
"the question 'what is love?' generates a host of issues: 
love is an abstract noun which means for some it is a word unattached to anything real or sensible, 
that is all; for others, it is a means by which our being—our self and its world—are irrevocably affected 
once we are ‘touched by love’; some have sought to analyze it, others have preferred to leave it in the realm of the ineffable."
