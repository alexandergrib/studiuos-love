February Hackaton topic was linked to Valentines day. Our team - Rebecca, Alex, Eric, Justinas, Martin and supervised by Gaff - decided to go for a Romantic Poetry Site with some added functionality as gift ideas, romantic movies or places.

Judging criteria were:
- Clear and substantial value to the user
- Original or innovative idea, design, or implementation
- Well-structured documentation and wireframes
- Well-planned and executed (GitHub Projects or Trello for Kanban Board)
- Realistic and a sense of completeness -> Please think Minimum Viable Product.

# 2. Features üíî
## 2.1 Implemented features

Most features were successfully implemented. 

There is consistent header and footer with appropriate links throughout all pages. Appealing pages with facts about love, poetry, gift ideas and ten top's were created with responsive design for smaller screens.
User's can also register and login/logout to create their profiles and access added functions which might be added later.

Home page is divided into four parts. The top part is displaying appealing hero image to grab users attention. Second - Check this out - a shortcut to suggest user what's not to be missed and to stay on a page. Third one promotes an online shop. This is also for best user experience. Last section is for people who came to find the right person and displays links for most popular dating services.

Love facts page has another hero image and provides people with information to uncover the love, to see the aspects of a true love but also to see the dark and sad side of the love. It also provides hints how to meet people, how to treat them and how to raise self-awareness. For easier readability text is broken down into paragraphs and associated pictures.

Top ten page display nice wedding picture and three carousels with corresponding topics - movies, places to help visitor how to spend a time together and famous quotes to help understand the love little bit better.

Gift Ideas page has satisfying red rose hero image. There are five articles. Four of them offers another view to more gits as heart shaped pizza or delicious chocolate box or stunning flowers. Link to same gift store is provided for visitors who could have missed this on a home page.

# 4. Testing üíè

## 4.1 Validation

HTML code was checked in W3C validator with no errors - https://validator.w3.org/

CSS code was checked in W3C validator with no errors - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Python code was checked in pep8 online and errors were fixed. White spaces at the end of lines, and lines with non compliant length were the only issues.  - https://pep8online.com/

Responsivness was tested in Chrome and Firefox on Win10 with Devtools, ipad mini 6th gen, onePlus 7pro phone and Am I Responsive website. Iphone 5 was used in Devtools as standard for smallest screen. Bootstrap Display properties, Grid system and CSS media queries were used to adapt responsive layout.

## 4.2 Features testing

Tests were completed on iPhone5, iPad and 1200px screen sizes. 


### Navbar
Navbar links were tested to ensure the user is redirected to appropriate page. Mobile drop-down navbar is displayed on pages under 992px.

### @app.route("/")
Route is working as expected and rendering the index.html page correctly.

### @app.route("/love_facts")
Route is working as expected and rendering the love_facts.html page correctly.

### @app.route("/topten")
This route is also working as expected and rendering topten.html page correctly.

### @app.route("/poetry")
This route handles two requests - GET and POST. GET request renders poems.html. POST request handles a form input and stores it in the MongoDB. These functionalities are working as expected. Flash messages are not displaying correctly. This will be reviewed.

### @app.route("/register")
Again this route accepts two requests - GET and POST. GET request renders register.html page. POST request is taking data from user registration form and stores them in user table in MongoDB. On successful registration the user name is stored in Session and user is logged in. For security reasons, passwords are hashed before storing. All functionalities work with no problem.

### @app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
Another route taking GET and POST requests. GET request renders login.html page. POST request takes input from login form. If user name is found in DB it proceeds with password verification. When password verification is successful a user name is stored in session and user is logged in. When password is incorrect a flash message is returned that either username or password are not correct. Same message is returned if user name is not found in DB. This is for enhanced security in a case attacker is trying to guess user names and passwords. These parts are working correctly. Flash messages are not displaying. This will be also reviewed.

### @app.route("/logout")
This route removes user from session and user is logged out. User is redirected to index.html. This is correct.

Apart Flash messages few more issues were found. Form validation will be implemented to avoid some system attacks. More confirmation request can be added for user convenience, e.g. to confirm log out action. More routes can also be added to handle HTML error status codes.

No other issues were found in HTML code. Links are working as expected. Navbar is responsive on screens smaller than 992px and comes with burger drop down button.
