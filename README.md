February Hackatons topic was linked to Valentines day. Our team - Rebecca, Alex, Eric, Justinas, Martin and supervised by Gaff - decided to go for a Romantic Poetry Site with some added funcionality as gift ideas, romantic movies or places.

Judging criteria were:
- Clear and substantial value to the user
- Original or innovative idea, design, or implementation
- Well-structured documentation and wireframes
- Well-planned and executed (GitHub Projects or Trello for Kanban Board)
- Realistic and a sense of completeness -> Please think Minimum Viable Product.
